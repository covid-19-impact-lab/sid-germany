    This does not support state specific yet. Once state specific policies
    are supported, subgroup_query, others_attend and the hygiene multiplier
    can be dictionaries where the keys are the names of the German states:
    'Baden-WÃ¼rttemberg', 'Bavaria', 'Berlin', 'Brandenburg', 'Bremen',
    'Hamburg', 'Hessen', 'Lower Saxony', 'Mecklenburg-Vorpommern',
    'North Rhine-Westphalia', 'Rhineland-Palatinate', 'Saarland', 'Saxony',
    'Saxony-Anhalt', 'Schleswig-Holstein' and 'Thuringia' and the values are
    the state specific subgroup_query, others_attend and hygiene multipliers.

    Args:
        group_id_column (str): name of the column identifying which indivdiuals
            attend class together, i.e. the assort by column of the current
            contact model. We assume that the column identifying which
            individuals belong to the A or B group is group_id_column + "_a_b".
        others_attend (bool): if True, children not selected by the subgroup
            query attend school normally. If False, children not selected by
            the subgroup query stay home.
        hygiene_multiplier (float): Applied to all children that still attend
            educational facilities.
        subgroup_query (str, optional): string identifying the children that
            are taught in split classes. If None, all children in all education
            facilities attend in split classes.
