sid-germany
===========

This repository holds the documentation for sid-germany.

.. warning::

    The documentation is in a very early stage. Useful descriptions can be found in the docstrings of modules and functions in the :ref:`api` section.

    We try to add more content in the future. If you are interested in a particular
    topic, raise an issue so that we can help you and extend the documentation.

    If you have a question about a particular data set (such as the vaccination data),
    all cleaned data and visualizations of most of them (such as the vaccination time series)
    can be found in the ``bld`` folder after the project is built.
